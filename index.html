<h1>My Core DevOps Manifesto - 
Adoption of the below highlighted DevOps methodologies and continuously brainstorm with the teams to find ways to improvise and seek optimal solutions from concept in the mind to cash in hand.</h1>

<p> People OVER Process over Tools </p>

<p> Continuous Delivery Practice of Coding, testing and validation  deployment and releases.</p>

<p> Minimum viable product, more efficiently and frequently, better quality; faster feedback mechanism. </p>

<p> Lean Management  </p>

<p> Change Control (Visible Ops CC) Eliminating fragile artefacts, creating repeatable build process, managing dependencies, encouraging an environment of continuous service improvement. </p>

<p> Infrastructure as Code Systems treated like code, checked into source code (including branching strategy), reviewed built and tested (eliminating those that cannot be a part of automated systems due to financial or other regulatory compliance requirements with complete automation feasibility check study), managed programmatically  (establish compile, run, kill repetitive process) </p>
